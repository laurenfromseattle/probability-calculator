# Probability Calculator
Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls. 
What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 
1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the 
probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to 
perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.

The Probability Calculator determines the approximate probability of drawing
certain colored balls randomly from a hat.
